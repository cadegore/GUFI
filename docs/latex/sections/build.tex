\section{Build}

GUFI uses CMake to generate Makefiles. CMake 3.19 or higher is
required. From the root directory of the GUFI source, run:
\begin{verbatim}
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. [options]
make
\end{verbatim}

The recommended options for deployment are
\texttt{-DCMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=Release -DCLIENT=On}.
\\\\
The list below shows the environments where GUFI is known to have
built, run, and passed tests at some point. The environments labeled
with a plus (+) are currently being used on Github Actions. The
environments labeled with minus (-) are no longer used on GitHub
Actions and might no longer work.

\subsubsection{Install Paths}
Files are categorized as server or client components. Instead of
installing to \texttt{BIN} and \texttt{LIB}, they can now be installed
to server and client specific paths. If the paths provided are
relative, they will be installed under
\texttt{CMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX}. If they are absolute, they will be
installed there. if \texttt{CLIENT=Off}, only the server values will
be used.
